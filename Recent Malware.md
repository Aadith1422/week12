## 1. ApolloShadow (Turla / Secret Blizzard)
**Summary:** ISP‑level AiTM campaign targeting diplomats and embassies using captive‑portal lures that deliver a fake Kaspersky update which installs **ApolloShadow** spyware.

**Technical details & TTPs:**
- Delivery via ISP/captive portals: victims connected to compromised local ISPs in Moscow are prompted to install a fake update.
- Installs a user/root certificate to intercept TLS traffic (man‑in‑the‑middle of HTTPS).
- Alters firewall and file‑sharing settings to facilitate lateral access and exfiltration.
- Likely used alongside passive interception infrastructure.

**Impact:** Targeted espionage: credentials, communications, and diplomatic data exfiltration.

**Detection & Indicators:**
- New/unexpected root certificates in the OS certificate store.
- Changes to firewall rules or unexpected SMB/file‑sharing enabling.
- Unusual TLS interception signs (cert chain mismatches, browser warnings suppressed).

**Mitigation:**
- Use vetted VPNs that terminate outside local ISP networks.
- Enforce phishing‑resistant MFA for sensitive accounts.
- Block installing updates via captive portals; perform updates from official vendor channels.
- Monitor certificate store and firewall configuration drift.

## 2. Scattered Spider (social engineering + ransomware)
**Summary:** A highly social‑engineering skilled group that blends advanced phishing, collaboration‑platform compromise, SIM swapping, and insider impersonation to deploy RATs and ransomware (e.g., DragonForce).

**Technical details & TTPs:**
- Primary vector: targeted social engineering (Slack/Teams messages, help‑desk impersonation, phone calls).
- MFA push bombing and SIM swap to bypass second factors.
- Abuse of Connected Apps / OAuth in SaaS (e.g., Salesforce) to harvest tokens and exfiltrate data.
- Post‑compromise: deploy RMM tools, RattyRAT, and ransomware families to perform encryption (often on VM hypervisors like ESXi).

**Impact:** Disruption of retail, insurance, and aviation sectors; data theft followed by encryption and extortion.

**Detection & Indicators:**
- Unusual OAuth/Connected App registrations and broad OAuth scopes granted without justification.
- Increased MFA push notifications, repeated failed MFA approvals.
- Large outbound transfers to cloud storage (S3, MEGA, etc.) prior to encryption.
- Unusual RMM or remote access tool deployments.

**Mitigation:**
- Enforce phishing‑resistant MFA (FIDO2 / hardware tokens).
- Audit and restrict Connected Apps and OAuth permissions; apply least privilege.
- Train help‑desk to validate identity with out‑of‑band checks.
- Monitor for exfiltration with DLP and cloud‑storage detections.

## 4. Shellter tool misuse
**Summary:** Shellter, a legitimate pentest tool, has been observed repurposed by threat actors to embed RATs/stealers into installers and binaries.

**Technical details & TTPs:**
- Attackers use Shellter to pack and obfuscate malware payloads inside otherwise legitimate binaries to evade static detection.
- Delivered payloads include ArechClient2, Sectop RAT, Rhadamanthys stealer families.

**Impact:** Increased success of commodity infostealer campaigns; difficulty in detection due to use of legitimate toolchains.

**Mitigation:**
- Strict control & auditing of pentest/red‑team tooling.
- Monitor for unexpected binaries or unusual signing/packaging activity.
- Use behavioral detection to catch payloads at runtime even if statically obfuscated.

## 5. AI‑Powered Ransomware & Agentic AI Threats (PromptLock, Ransomware 3.0)
**Summary:** Research prototypes (PromptLock) demonstrate using LLMs to dynamically generate malicious scripts and adapt behavior at runtime; threat actors are also using AI to automate negotiations and scale reconnaissance.

**Technical details & TTPs:**
- PromptLock (PoC): local LLM (gpt‑oss via Ollama) generates Lua scripts for enumeration and encryption; uses SPECK encryption and runtime polymorphism.
- Agentic AI: autonomous agents used to craft phishing campaigns, run credential stuffing, and manage multi‑step attack chains.
- AI chatbots are being used by ransomware gangs to automate negotiation and victim communication.

**Impact:** Makes static signature detection less effective; enables lower skill actors to mount complex attacks.

**Detection & Indicators:**
- Binaries that spawn local LLM processes or call LLM API endpoints.
- Highly polymorphic runtime scripts and varied process behavior between instances.
- Unusual API traffic to model hosting endpoints (Ollama, private LLM hosts) from endpoints.

**Mitigation:**
- Behavioral EDR/XDR focused on script execution and dynamic code loading.
- Limit network access to unvetted LLM endpoints; secure internal model hosting.
- Emphasize backups and rapid response planning over signature reliance.

## 6. FileFix / Clipboard‑based Silent Social Engineering
**Summary:** Malicious websites inject PowerShell commands or payloads into a user's clipboard; if the user pastes and executes them (e.g., into a Run dialog or shell), the code runs silently.

**Technical details & TTPs:**
- Attack flow: lure → site copies obfuscated PowerShell to clipboard → user instructed to paste into Run or PowerShell → script executes in user context.
- Low noise because no file is written to disk and user interaction appears manual.

**Impact:** Bypasses some file‑based controls and user training; effective in targeted scams.

**Detection & Indicators:**
- Frequent or unusual PowerShell invocation from browser parent processes.
- Clipboard monitoring spikes followed by immediate PowerShell execution.
- Browser-to-process parent relationships spawning command interpreters.

**Mitigation:**
- User education (do not paste commands from web pages), restrict PowerShell execution via AppLocker/WDAC.
- Log and alert on PowerShell executions that originate from browser processes.

**References:** ITPro and vendor reports.

## 10. Detection, Hunting, & Recommendations (Operational Priorities)
**Short list of practical detection signals:**
- Unexpected child processes from browsers/office apps (e.g., `winword.exe -> powershell.exe`).
- Frequent PowerShell one‑liners that contain `-enc`, `IEX`, `Invoke-Expression`, or base64 payloads.
- New root certs installed or certificate store modifications.
- High‑entropy outbound POSTs and connections to cloud storage providers shortly before file deletion/encryption.
- Unusual OAuth/Connected App installations and unexpected token grants in SaaS platforms.
- Processes spawning interpreters (Lua, VBS, Python) and performing many file reads in short time windows.

**Top operational priorities:**
1. Harden identity & authentication: phishing‑resistant MFA, monitor for OAuth abuse.
2. Patch management & vulnerability triage: prioritize internet‑facing servers (SharePoint, ESXi, RMM tools).
3. Backup & recovery readiness: immutable/offline backups and regular restore exercises.
4. Endpoint & mobile protection: EDR + MTD + App controls; block execution from untrusted paths.
5. Threat intel sharing & collaboration: ingest advisories (CISA, MSFT, vendor feeds) and join ISACs.
6. Test incident response: tabletop exercises and documented playbooks for ransomware / espionage incidents.
