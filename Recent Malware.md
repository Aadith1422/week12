## 1) Lumma Stealer (aka LummaC2)
**Type:** Infostealer (Windows)  
**Disruption:** Microsoft + partners disrupted ~2,300 domains in May 2025, cutting a network of ~394,000 infected hosts.

### Summary
Lumma Stealer is one of the most prolific information-stealing malware families. Sold as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) since 2022, it remains a top threat in 2025.

### Technical details
- Delivery: phishing emails, fake software downloads, cracked apps, malvertising.  
- Execution: small loader downloads encrypted payload from C2.  
- Capabilities:  
  - Steals browser credentials, cookies, autofill data.  
  - Extracts cryptocurrency wallets.  
  - Collects Telegram/Discord data.  
  - Creates machine fingerprint.  

### Indicators / Observables
- Outbound C2 connections with rotating domains.  
- Encrypted HTTP POST requests with base64 blobs.  
- Dropped files in `%AppData%` or `%Temp%`.  

### Impact
Credential theft → account takeover, fraud, resale on darknet.

### Mitigation
- Block known Lumma infrastructure.  
- Enforce MFA, disable browser password storage.  
- Monitor anomalous HTTP POST traffic.

## 2) RatOn (Android Banking Trojan)
**Type:** Mobile Trojan  
**Discovered:** 2025 (Czech Republic, expanding globally).

### Summary
RatOn is an Android banking Trojan capable of automatic unauthorized money transfers.

### Technical details
- Initial vector: malicious APKs disguised as legitimate apps.  
- Techniques:  
  - Accessibility Service abuse for UI control.  
  - Fake overlays mimicking bank logins.  
  - MFA bypass via SMS/push interception.  
  - Automatic Transfer System (ATS).  

### Indicators / Observables
- Apps requesting Accessibility + overlay permissions.  
- Background services with obfuscated names.  
- Encrypted HTTPS C2 traffic.  

### Impact
Direct bank fraud, account drain.

### Mitigation
- Avoid sideloading APKs, use Play Store.  
- MDM to block unknown apps.  
- Banks: detect anomalous transfers.

## 3) GhostRedirector (Rungan & Gamshen)
**Type:** SEO manipulation malware on IIS servers  

### Summary
Compromises IIS servers to boost fraudulent gambling sites by cloaking SEO content for Googlebot.

### Technical details
- Initial access: SQL injection, web app exploits.  
- Payloads:  
  - *Rungan* backdoor.  
  - *Gamshen* trojan injecting SEO spam for crawlers.  
- Persistence: scheduled tasks, registry entries.  

### Indicators / Observables
- IIS logs: differential crawler vs user responses.  
- Unknown DLLs in w3wp.exe.  
- Outbound C2 traffic.  

### Impact
SEO poisoning, reputation damage, blacklisting.

### Mitigation
- Patch web apps, harden IIS AppPools.  
- File integrity monitoring.  
- Crawl-diff monitoring.

## 4) PromptLocker / Ransomware 3.0
**Type:** AI-assisted ransomware (research PoC)  

### Summary
NYU researchers built an LLM-orchestrated ransomware demonstrating autonomous reconnaissance, encryption, and ransom-note generation.

### Technical details
- File discovery by “valuable extensions.”  
- Automatic ransom-note crafting.  
- Script generation for encryption (Python/PowerShell).  
- Data exfil simulation.  

### Indicators / Observables
- Temp files with LLM prompt fragments.  
- Scripting engines executing AI-generated code.  
- Large file enumeration by non-admin processes.  

### Impact
Not active in wild yet, but shows ransomware at machine speed.

### Mitigation
- Restrict unnecessary LLM use on endpoints.  
- Monitor scripting anomalies.  
- Strengthen backups + DLP.

## 5) LOSTKEYS (Cold River APT)
**Type:** Espionage malware  
**Actor:** Cold River (Russia-linked APT)

### Summary
Google TAG (2025) discovered LOSTKEYS, used for espionage against Western/Ukraine-related targets.

### Technical details
- Delivery: spear-phishing, malicious docs, watering-hole.  
- Capabilities: file exfiltration, clipboard capture, keylogging.  
- Persistence: registry, startup folders.  
- C2: HTTPS with domain fronting.  

### Indicators / Observables
- PowerShell spawning Office processes.  
- Beaconing HTTPS traffic to CDNs.  
- Files in `%ProgramData%\LOSTKEYS\`.  

### Impact
Espionage: stolen sensitive political/defense data.

### Mitigation
- Train staff on spear-phishing.  
- Hunt HTTPS beaconing anomalies.  
- Disable macros by default, patch Office.

## ✅ Cross-cutting defenses
- Enforce MFA everywhere.  
- Patch exposed apps (IIS, Android, Office).  
- Deploy EDR/XDR with heuristic detection.  
- Keep offline, immutable backups.  
- Apply least privilege & network segmentation.
